# e-commerce-api
 API for e-commerce website using node js and its packages

To use the application, open this link: https://backend-e-commerce-api.onrender.com

Please note that there will be a 30 .- 60 seconds delay at first,but after then, you should be good. This happens because of the free tier on render, which is where I upload most of my projects on.

Developer's Note: No matter how far I go in this life, I'll always call this project "my baby", it's (in my opinion) so complete as an API, I felt like I did a great job here. I implemented Features like: Creating, Updating, Deleting, and Retrieving Users, Products, Reviews, Etc. Managing products and jts information, Authenticated API routes etc.
